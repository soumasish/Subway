# Subway

#### What is Subway?
Subway is a distributed enterprise messaging platform that lets users publish and subscribe to streams of events in real time. 
It provides reliable, linearized and fault-tolerant storage of these streams of events. 
Subway is run as a cluster on one or more servers. The Subway cluster stores streams of events in categories called topics. Each record consists of a key, a value, and a timestamp.

### API
Currently Subway provides two main families of python APIs:
* Producer 
* Consumer
